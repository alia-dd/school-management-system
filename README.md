## Simple Node.js School Management System

The Simple Node.js School Management System is a web application built using Node.js, Express.js, and MongoDB Atlas. It provides a dashboard that displays essential information such as the number of students, teachers, subjects, and total revenue. The system stores data about subjects, teachers, and students in separate collections within MongoDB Atlas.

### Key Features:

1. **Dashboard Overview:**
   - The dashboard provides an overview of key metrics, including the number of students, teachers, subjects, and total revenue.
   - These metrics are dynamically updated based on changes in the database.

2. **Database Integration with MongoDB Atlas:**
   - MongoDB Atlas is used as the backend database to store information about subjects, teachers, and students.
   - Each entity (subjects, teachers, students) is stored in a separate collection, facilitating efficient data management and retrieval.

3. **Student Registration:**
   - Students can register through a form that includes fields for personal information and selection of subjects.
   - The subjects available for selection are populated dynamically from the subjects collection in the database.

4. **Assignment of Projects to Teachers:**
   - Projects or assignments are assigned to teachers within the system.
   - The system tracks which projects are assigned to each teacher and presents this information in a table format.

### How It Works:

- **Express.js Server:** The application is built on the Express.js framework, which handles routing and middleware integration.
- **MongoDB Atlas Integration:** The application connects to a MongoDB Atlas cluster to store and retrieve data.
- **Dynamic Dropdowns:** When a student registers, the available subjects are dynamically populated in the dropdown menu based on the data stored in the subjects collection.
- **CRUD Operations:** The system supports Create, Read, Update, and Delete (CRUD) operations for managing subjects, teachers, and students.
- **Data Presentation:** Information about assigned projects and other details are presented in tabular format for easy reference and management.

### Future Enhancements:

- **Authentication and Authorization:** Implement user authentication and authorization to secure access to the system.
- **Email Notifications:** Introduce email notifications for important events such as student registrations, project assignments, and deadlines.
- **Enhanced Reporting:** Generate detailed reports and analytics based on student performance, teacher workload, and other relevant metrics.
- **Interactive Dashboard:** Create an interactive dashboard with charts and graphs to visualize data trends and patterns.
